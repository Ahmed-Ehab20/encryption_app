# COMPLETE FIX GUIDE FOR DECRYPTED TEXT VISIBILITY

## ISSUE SUMMARY
The decrypted text was not showing up due to several issues:

1. **Wrong Data Key**: The code was looking for 'plaintext' but the data uses the key 'decrypted'.
2. **Insufficient Contrast**: The background opacity was too low (0.3) making text hard to see in dark mode.
3. **Missing Border**: The container blended into the background without a visible boundary.
4. **Text Styling**: Font weight and sizing needed improvement.
5. **Clipboard Issues**: The clipboard functionality was also using the wrong key.

## COMPLETE FIXES

### 1. Fix in main.dart

The most important fix is to update the Container in the _buildResults method (around line 2116):

```dart
Container(
  width: double.infinity,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(12),
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: isDark
        ? Colors.black.withOpacity(0.9)  // CHANGED from 0.3 to 0.9
        : Colors.white,                  // CHANGED from Colors.grey.withOpacity(0.1)
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
    border: Border.all(                  // ADDED border
      color: isDark
          ? Colors.white.withOpacity(0.6)
          : Colors.black.withOpacity(0.3),
      width: 1.5,
    ),
  ),
  child: Text(
    result['decrypted'] ?? '',          // CHANGED from 'plaintext' to 'decrypted'
    style: TextStyle(
      color: isDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,      // ADDED font weight
      fontSize: 16,                     // CHANGED from 15
      letterSpacing: 0.5,               // ADDED letter spacing
      height: 1.4,                      // ADDED line height
    ),
  ),
),
```

### 2. Fix the clipboard code (around line 2149)

```dart
Clipboard.setData(ClipboardData(text: result['decrypted'] ?? ''));
```

### 3. Fix the _addToHistory method (around line 2760)

```dart
resultText: result['decrypted'] ?? '',
```

## DEBUGGING TOOLS

If the text still doesn't show up, use the debug_result_info.dart widget to see what's in your result map:

1. Import the debug file at the top of main.dart:
```dart
import 'package:your_app/debug_result_info.dart';
```

2. Add the widget after the "Decrypted Text:" section:
```dart
Text('Decrypted Text:', ...),
SizedBox(height: 8),
DebugResultInfo(result: result, isDark: isDark),  // ADD THIS LINE
SizedBox(height: 8),
Container(...),
```

3. Run the app and check what keys are actually available in the result map.

## OTHER POSSIBLE ISSUES

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Empty Results**: Check if _results list is empty when you try to display.
2. **Result Structure**: Confirm that your results are properly formatted Maps.
3. **Other Keys**: The data might be using yet another key name (check with debug widget).
4. **Layout Issues**: Try removing any Expanded widgets that might be limiting height.
5. **Overflow**: Check if text is overflowing its container (add overflow: TextOverflow.visible).

If none of these work, use the debug_result_info.dart widget to determine exactly what's in your result map.
