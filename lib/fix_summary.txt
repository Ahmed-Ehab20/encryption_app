DECRYPTED TEXT VISIBILITY FIX - SUMMARY

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
----------------
1. WRONG DATA KEY: The code was looking for 'plaintext' in the result map, but data is actually stored with the key 'decrypted'.

2. INSUFFICIENT CONTRAST: The background opacity (0.3) was too low in dark mode, making text difficult to see.

3. MISSING BORDER: Without a border, the container blended into the background too much.

4. TEXT STYLING: The font weight and size could be improved for better readability.

5. CLIPBOARD CODE: The clipboard copy function was also looking for the wrong key.

6. HISTORY UPDATE: The _addToHistory method was using the wrong key as well.

SOLUTIONS:
---------
1. USE CORRECT KEY: Change all references from 'plaintext' to 'decrypted':
   - In the Text widget: result['decrypted'] instead of result['plaintext']
   - In the Clipboard code
   - In the _addToHistory method

2. INCREASE CONTRAST:
   - Dark mode: Change background opacity from 0.3 to 0.9 (nearly opaque black)
   - Light mode: Use pure white instead of light gray
   - Use maximum contrast text colors (pure white/black)

3. ADD VISIBLE BORDER:
   - Add a 1.5px border that's visible in both light and dark modes
   - Use white border in dark mode, black border in light mode

4. IMPROVE TEXT STYLING:
   - Increase font weight to 600 (semi-bold)
   - Increase font size from 15 to 16
   - Add letter spacing (0.5)
   - Add line height (1.4) for better readability

HOW TO APPLY THE FIX:
-------------------
1. Locate the Container widget in _buildResults method (around line 2116)
2. Replace it with the version in direct_decryption_fix.dart
3. Update the clipboard code around line 2149
4. Update the _addToHistory method's resultText parameter

DEBUGGING AIDS:
-------------
If the text is still not visible, use the debug_text_display.dart widget to see:
1. What keys are actually available in the result map
2. What text is being extracted from different keys
3. A high-contrast display of the found text

This will help identify exactly where the text is stored in the result map.
